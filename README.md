Hi!

Currently in this repository I have 2 projects:

- Planet - for computation of solar orbits. It contains two files.
           First 'computation_optimalization.ipynb' is what I did from plain math to make it compute faster.
           Second 'main_project.ipynb' shows latest version of this project.

- Stockproject - It covers transformation of data and building a website with Django. For frontend I used Bootstrap template.
                 Charts are not working currently, mainly, because of JS that I'm new to.
                 Currently building authentication system.

Both are  work in progress, but I hope you'll enjoy what you see.
